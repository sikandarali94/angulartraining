    There is a special directive -- even though it looks like a component, but it does not
    have its own template -- we can add in the server-element component template here in the
    place where we want to render the content we can add ng-content as shown below. Since we
    are placing elements content between the app-server-element tags in our app component
    template whatever is placed inside those tags will be generated within the place where
    we put the ng-content directive. This ng-content therefore acts like a 'hook' for where
    the elements content -- between the app-server-element tags -- are placed. The element
    contents is then said to be 'projected' into our server-element component.
