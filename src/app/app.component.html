        We might think changing the href to the relevant paths will get our routes to work. At first sight they
        do, but the issue is that the href reloads the app and this is not what we want. We want to route
        without reloading the app.
        That is why we use routerLink of Angular instead of href of HTML. routerLink tells Angular that this is
        a link but when the link is selected, Angular handles it differently.

        <li role="presentation"><a routerLink="/servers">Servers</a></li>
        <!--
        We can use routerLink as property binding and this gives us more flexibility, as we will see later on.
        The array notation is not really needed below as we can just write "'/users'", however, the array
        notation will be more useful later on as it allows us to construct more complex paths.

      We have to tell Angular where to display the currently selected component. We remove all the selectors
      of the components like we did and use a special directive called <router-outlet></router-outlet> that
      loads the components depending upon the path in the url.
