      We don't need to set any value to appBasicHighlight and importantly we don't use square brackets
      because the directive name is just a selector we set up in basic-highlight.directive.ts. The square
      brackets in that file are not part of that name; it's part of this selector style telling Angular
      please select it as an attribute on an element. And that is how add appBasicHighlight here: like
      an attribute to the paragraph.

      <p appBasicHighlight>Style me with basic directive!</p>
