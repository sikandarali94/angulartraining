        We might think changing the href to the relevant paths will get our routes to work. At first sight they
        do, but the issue is that the href reloads the app and this is not what we want. We want to route
        without reloading the app.
        That is why we use routerLink of Angular instead of href of HTML. routerLink tells Angular that this is
        a link but when the link is selected, Angular handles it differently.
        -->
        <!--
        In Angular we have to be wary of using absolute paths or relative paths. In here if we wrote '/servers'
        [absolute] or 'servers' [relative] it will give us both 'localhost:4200/servers'. However, if we did
        this in the servers component, and wrote the same thing, for relative path we would get
        'localhost:4200/servers/servers', but for absolute path we would get 'localhost:4200/servers'.
        -->
        <!--
        routerLinkActive directive allows us to change the style of a link depending upon which route path
        is active. We just have to provide the directive with the class that contains the style for indicating
        what an active link should look like e.g. routerLinkActive="active" [active is a CSS class defined in
        Bootstrap].
        routerLinkActive, by default, marks an element as "active" if it 'contains' the path we are on. In the
        example below, the Home path is "/". The Home path will always be marked as "active" by routerLinkActive
        because its router path is always contained whenever we go to 'Servers' and 'Users' -- in other words,
        "localhost:4200/servers" or "localhost:4200/users" always contains "localhost:4200/", which is the path
        for Home. Thus, routerLinkActive will always apply the CSS class we passed to it on the Home link.
        To fix this default behaviour by routerLinkActive we can access its settings through
        [routerLinkActiveOptions] -- it needs property binding because we don't just pass a string but a JS object,
        as shown below. We access the exact property within routerLinkActiveOptions and set it true. This tells
        routerLinkActive directive to only apply the CSS class to the link that has the exact path in the URL rather
        than contained in the URL.
        -->
        <li role="presentation" routerLinkActive="active" [routerLinkActiveOptions]="{exact: true}"><a routerLink="/">Home</a></li>
        <li role="presentation" routerLinkActive="active"><a routerLink="/servers">Servers</a></li>
        <!--
        We can use routerLink as property binding and this gives us more flexibility, as we will see later on.
        The array notation is not really needed below as we can just write "'/users'", however, the array
        notation will be more useful later on as it allows us to construct more complex paths.
        -->
        <li role="presentation" routerLinkActive="active"><a [routerLink]="['/users']">Users</a></li>

      We have to tell Angular where to display the currently selected component. We remove all the selectors
      of the components like we did and use a special directive called <router-outlet></router-outlet> that
      loads the components depending upon the path in the url.
