          A pipe is used to transform the output. So, therefore, the logical place to use it is in the template.
          We use the pipe symbol (|) and the name of the pipe (e.g. uppercase, date), as shown below.
          -->
          <strong>{{ server.name }}</strong> |
          <!--
          uppercase transforms the data to uppercase.
          -->
          {{ server.instanceType | uppercase }} |
          <!--
          date transforms date data to a proper date. In our case it transformed:
          "Mon Aug 09 1920 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)" to "Aug 9, 1920"
          -->
          <!--
          We can paramaterize a pipe to configure in detail what the transformed data should look like. We configure
          a pipe using a colon (:) and passing a parameter as a string, as shown below. 'fullDate' parameter of the
          date pipe transformed: "Mon Aug 09 1920 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)" to
          "Monday, August 9, 1920".
          For multiple parameters, we separate each parameter with a colon (:).
          -->
          <!--
          We can chain multiple pipes by separating them with the pipe symbol (|), as shown below and are interpreted
          left to right. The way the below example works is that date:'fullDate' is applied to server.started data and
          then uppercase is applied to the result of that transformation. So if we were to apply the uppercase pipe
          first and then date:'fullDate', we would get an error because the date transformed would be all uppercase
          rather than in this format: "Mon Aug 09 1920 00:00:00 GMT+1000 (Australian Eastern Standard Time)". Therefore
          date:'fullDate' does not recognise the format as being all uppercase and that is the reason we get an error.
          Therefore, the order of the pipes is highly important.
