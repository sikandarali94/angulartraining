      <!-- Notice that we don't have the action attribute on the form tag. We are also not specifying the method
      attribute either. Tis is because we don't want this form to be submitted to a server. We want Angular to handle
      this form.
      Angular, when it detects a form element, automatically creates a JS Object representation of the form for us.
      This is an example of what the representation looks like:
      {
        value: {
          name: 'Sikandar Ali',
          email: 'a@b.com"
        },
        valid: true
      }
      We can think of this form element serving as a selector for an Angular directive which then creates such a JS
      Object representation of the form for us. Of course we can't that form representation as of now AND it would be
      very empty. One thing that does not happen automatically is that Angular does not automatically detect our form
      inputs. Simple reason for this is that whilst we could argue that it should be able to scan our form for inputs,
      we might not want to add all these inputs as values/controls to our JS object representation of the form.
      Therefore we need to register our form inputs manually as values/controls for the JS object representation of
      the form.

      <!--
      ngSubmit will be fired whenever this form is submitted, or in other words, whenever the submit event is fired.
      We provide the method or code to run to ngSubmit whenever the submit event is fired. To get access to JS object
      representation of the form created by Angular we can place a local reference on the form (#f) and pass it to
      the method provided to ngSubmit. When we just pass the reference of the form, we get the entire HTML DOM elements
      of the form. However, we only want the JS Object representation of the form. To do this we equal the local ref to
      ngForm. This is because the form exposes form data and that data is captured by ngForm.
      -->
      <!--
      Although we will usually pass a local reference to get access to the JS object representation of our form, there
      is another approach to getting access. We can use @ViewChild. That means we do not pass the local reference into
      onSubmit() as shown below.
      -->
      <form (ngSubmit)="onSubmit()" #f="ngForm">
        <div id="user-data">
          <div class="form-group">
            <label for="username">Username</label>
            <!--
            To add a form input as a control for the JS object representation of our form, we simply attach ngModel
            on it, as shown below. We used ngModel for two-way data binding but this directive has a lot more features
            to it than two-way data binding. We just need to provide the name of the control. We do this with the HTML
            attribute of name, as shown below. This name would be a key in the value object of the JS object
            representation of the form.

        Putting a click event listener on the submit button is not the best place to register whether a user has
        submitted a form or not. A better alternative is that if a button of type submit is used to submit a form,
        the JS submit event is fired. We should use submit event to register whether a form has been submitted.
