        Sometimes we don't get an error message but he have a logic error in our
        code. We can debug these kinds of errors using the developer tools in our
        browser. We first go to 'Sources' and open up the file we want to debug
        in the webpack folder. We can then add breakpoints to the code we want
        to examine and see the values of the variables whenever the code is executed
        on the lines we added breakpoints to.
