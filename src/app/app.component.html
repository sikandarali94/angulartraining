      <!-- Notice that we don't have the action attribute on the form tag. We are also not specifying the method
      attribute either. Tis is because we don't want this form to be submitted to a server. We want Angular to handle
      this form.
      Angular, when it detects a form element, automatically creates a JS Object representation of the form for us.
      This is an example of what the representation looks like:
      {
        value: {
          name: 'Sikandar Ali',
          email: 'a@b.com"
        },
        valid: true
      }
      We can think of this form element serving as a selector for an Angular directive which then creates such a JS
      Object representation of the form for us. Of course we can't that form representation as of now AND it would be
      very empty. One thing that does not happen automatically is that Angular does not automatically detect our form
      inputs. Simple reason for this is that whilst we could argue that it should be able to scan our form for inputs,
      we might not want to add all these inputs as values/controls to our JS object representation of the form.
      Therefore we need to register our form inputs manually as values/controls for the JS object representation of
      the form.

            <!--
            To add a form input as a control for the JS object representation of our form, we simply attach ngModel
            on it, as shown below. We used ngModel for two-way data binding but this directive has a lot more features
            to it than two-way data binding. We just need to provide the name of the control. We do this with the HTML
            attribute of name, as shown below. This name would be a key in the value object of the JS object
            representation of the form.
