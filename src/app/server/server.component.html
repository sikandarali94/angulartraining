    Double curly brackets ({{  }}) are used for string interpolation.
    Inside, any expression that will result in the output of a string
    will be successfully interpolated. Within string interpolation we
    cannot write multi-line expressions here or you can't write block
    expressions here. For serverId and serverStatus we defined these
    variables in server.component.ts in export class ServerComponent{}.

    The interesting thing here is that serverId is a number but string
    interpolation only works when the expression will result in a
    string. The reason serverId is successfully interpolated is
    because a number can be converted into a string, and that is what
    has happened here. So in the end you either have to get a string
    within string interpolation or something that can be converted
    into a string.

    Another interesting this is that we can call a method in string
    interpolation, provided the method returns something that can
    be converted into a string or is a string itself.

    ngStyle is a built-in attribute directive. These are called attribute
    directives because they look like normal HTML attributes (without a
    star(*) basically to distinguish them from structural directives).
    Unlike structural directives, attribute directives don't add or
    remove elements. They only change the element they were placed on.
    With ngStyle we need to give it a configuration to do something.
    The square brackets is not part of the ngStyle name. They indicate
    that we want to bind to some property on this directive and this
    property name happens to also be ngStyle. ngStyle property expects
    to get a Javascript object and we can map key-value pairs of style
    names (as key) paired with style values (as value). For the key we
    can type the key name within a quotation mark like this:
    'background-color'
    Or we can use camel casing like this: backgroundColor
    Because we want to conditionally set the background color depending
    upon the server status we can execute a method that returns the
    value of the background-color depending upon the server status. We
    define this method in our component model. Therefore ngStyle allows
    to dynamically add styles.

<!--
    Where ngStyle allowed us to apply styles dynamically, ngClass allows
    us to apply or remove classes dynamically. ngClass, like ngStyle only
    works when using property binding. We also pass a Javascript object
    to ngClass with key-value pairs. The keys are the CSS class names
    and the values are the conditions determining whether this class
    should be attached or not. If a class name has a dash between names
    like this: online-server, we wrap it in single quotes like this:
    'online-server'. Also, we can pass as a value a method which either
    returns true or false.

<p [ngStyle]="{backgroundColor: getColor()}" [ngClass]="{online: serverStatus === 'online'}">{{ 'Server' }} with ID {{ serverId }} is {{ getServerStatus() }}</p>
