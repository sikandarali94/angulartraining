/* The usual behaviour of CSS is that it applies the styles to the whole document.
However, Angular has changed this behaviour and these styles only get applied to
what is in the app component and not what is present in the whole document of the
browser. And this is a helpful behaviour because it allows us to define only those
styles that we want for the elements in that component template.
