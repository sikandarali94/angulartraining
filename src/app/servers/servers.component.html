<!--
Square brackets ([]) indicate to Angular that we are using property binding.
It tells Angular that we want to dynamically bind a property.Each HTML
element we use is parsed by the browser and kind of translated into a element
on the DOM. Therefore we have an element in this DOM and this element has a
couple of properties. A lot of these can't even be set through attributes on the
HTML element. One of those properties is the disabled property and we can set it
through the disabled attribute but here we are not using the 'disabled attribute
anymore. With the square brackets we are directly binding to this native disabled
property this HTML element has. Thus, there are a lot of native properties of
elements that we can property bind to. Some of these native properties are resolved
through a boolean but some are resolved through other values. The disabled native
property is resolved to a true boolean so that is why we equal it to !allowNewServer,
because if allowNewServer is false within the component model then we want the button
to be disabled.
-->
<button class="btn btn-primary" [disabled]="!allowNewServer">Add Server</button>
<!--
Components are reusable in Angular. So we can use this
-->
<app-server></app-server>
<app-server></app-server>
