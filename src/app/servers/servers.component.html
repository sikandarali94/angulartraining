      To add query parameters (where key-value is prefixed with a question mark e.g. ?mode=edit) we use queryParams
      property of the routerLink directive as shown below.
      {allowEdit: '1'} gives us ?allowEdit=1 in the URL. We can have multiple key-value pairs in queryParams.
      To add fragments (where value is prefixed with a hash symbol e.g. #loading) we use fragment property of the
      routerLink directive as shown below.
      -->
      <!--
      PLEASE NOTE: We should write the fragment property as: fragment="'loading'" and not as [fragment]="['loading']"
      because it does not work. This is a correction to the comment that was written for 'Passing Query Parameters and
      Fragments' lecture.

      We need to provide a hook to tell Angular where to load the components of the child routes. Like we used
      <router-outlet></router-outlet> to load the components of the parent routes in app.component.html, we use
      <router-outlet></router-outlet> here to load the components of the child routes. We commented out the
      rest of the elements because we want the the child route component to load when the current URL matches
      the path defined for the child routes.
